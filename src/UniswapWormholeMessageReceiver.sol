 * @title Uniswap Wormhole Message Receiver
 * @dev This contract receives and executes Uniswap governance proposals that were sent from the UniswapWormholeMessageSender
 * contract on Ethereum via Wormhole.
 *
 * It enforces that proposals are executed in order, but it does not guarantee that all proposals are executed.
 * i.e. The message sequence number of proposals must be strictly monotonically increasing, but need not be consecutive
 * The maximum number of proposals that can be received is therefore UINT64_MAX.
 * For example, if there are proposals 1, 2 and 3, then the following are valid executions (not exhaustive):
 * - 1,2,3
 * - 1,3
 * But the following are impossible (not exhaustive):
 * - 1,3,2
